"""Tool system — adapter-provided domain primitives the engine can invoke.

The cognitive engine is code-centric and domain-agnostic.  Many tasks
within an episode require domain-specific computation — BFS on a 2-D
grid, motion planning in a 3-D workspace, connected-component labelling,
symmetry detection, pattern matching — that are deterministic and well
suited to hand-written code.  Doing these through an LLM is slow,
expensive, and error-prone; doing them in the engine directly would
contaminate the engine with domain knowledge.

The solution is a **Tool registry**: the adapter declares a set of typed
callable primitives it provides, and the engine invokes them through a
generic request/response protocol.  Miners, the Planner, the Explorer,
and the Mediator can all issue ToolInvocations; the adapter executes them
and returns ToolResults.

Two invocation modes are supported:

* **Synchronous** — ``ToolSignature.is_async == False``.  The adapter
  returns the result immediately.  Used for fast deterministic tools
  (grid BFS on a 100×100 grid, pattern match, diff).

* **Asynchronous** — ``ToolSignature.is_async == True``.  The engine
  issues the invocation and continues; the adapter posts the result
  later via callback or a pull-style pending-result queue.  Used for
  slow tools (e.g. a motion planner that may take seconds).

Tool latency is exposed on the signature so the Planner can budget
real-time costs when selecting among alternatives.  Determinism is
exposed so the engine may memoise results and avoid redundant calls.

This module defines only the data types for the registry and protocol.
Invocation dispatch lives in the adapter boundary
(``core.cognitive_os.engine.adapters`` in a later phase); memoisation
and budget tracking live in the runtime
(``core.cognitive_os.engine.episode_runner``).

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ToolSignature:
    """Description of a tool the adapter makes available.

    The signature is the engine's entire view of a tool: it does NOT
    contain the implementation.  That lives in the adapter.  The engine
    invokes tools by name, passing arguments that match
    ``input_schema``; the adapter is responsible for dispatch and for
    returning a ``ToolResult`` whose ``result`` field matches
    ``output_schema``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name
        Unique identifier used in ToolInvocation.
    description
        Human- and Mediator-readable description.  Shown to the Mediator
        in WorldStateSummary so it knows what tools already exist before
        proposing new ones.
    input_schema
        Tuple of ``(param_name, type_hint)`` pairs.  Type hints are
        strings for now (e.g. ``"int"``, ``"tuple[int,int]"``,
        ``"Grid"``) rather than Python types, to keep the registry
        trivially serialisable for Mediator consumption.
    output_schema
        Type description of the result, same format as parameter type
        hints.
    cost
        Unitless cost used by the Planner to compare alternatives.
        Calibrated so that a "typical inexpensive primitive" is 1.0.
    typical_latency_ms
        Expected wall-clock latency for a call.  The Planner uses this
        to budget real-time expenditure — important in robotics where
        latency matters.  Set realistically from profiling.
    determinism
        True if repeated calls with identical arguments always return
        identical results.  Deterministic tools may be memoised by the
        runtime; non-deterministic tools (e.g. a sampled motion planner
        or a stochastic perception pipeline) must not be.
    side_effects
        True if calling the tool mutates world state.  Most adapter
        primitives are pure queries (side_effects=False); some
        robotics tools (e.g. "actuate gripper") are actions disguised
        as tool calls and do have side effects.  The engine treats
        side-effectful tool calls the same way it treats normal
        actions (expected_effects generate TransitionClaims).
    is_async
        If True, the tool's invocation returns a pending handle; the
        result arrives later via callback or a pull-style queue.  If
        False, the invocation is synchronous and the result is
        available immediately.
